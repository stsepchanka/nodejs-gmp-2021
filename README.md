## To run tasks

- npm ci

Please use
```
npm ci
```
instead of
```
npm i
```
It is weird, but after using 'npm i' babel-node stopped working.
The best way of installing babel packages for me was to install all three packages by one command 
```
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/node
```

- npm run test1

- npm run test2
